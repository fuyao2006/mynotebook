==> Before using VMware, you need to reboot or load vmw_vmci and vmmon kernel modules (in a terminal on root: modprobe -a vmw_vmci vmmon)
==> You may also need to enable some of these services:
- vmware-networks.service: to have network access in VMs
- vmware-usbarbitrator.service: to connect USB devices inside VMs
- vmware-hostd.service: to share VMs on the network

vmware-workstation 的可选依赖
	linux-headers: build modules against Arch kernel
